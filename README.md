# bch-nostr

This is an node.js npm library for interactions between BCH and Nostr. Here are some of the things this library allows you to do:

- Generate a Nostr `npub` address with a BCH private key.
- Send E2EE messages to a BCH address. Store the encrypted message on Nostr.
- Check a BCH address to see it is has received E2EE messages.
- Download and decrypt messages stored on Nostr.
